Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans. We need data structures to hold objects and variable in one accessible place

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Ans. Search, insert ,delete , access.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans: Compiler Design,Operating System,Database Management System,Statistical analysis package, Numerical Analysis,
Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, and Simulation.

what is an Array?
Ans: Collection of data type same variable.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: Array size are fixed must be declared must be initialization ,ArrayLists are dynamic , can grow or shrink.

what is LinkedList?
Ans: A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Ans: The difference between Array and Linked list regards to their structure. Arrays are index based data
structure where each element associated with an index.While a linked list is a data structure which contains a
sequence of the elements where each element is linked to its next element.

what is queue?
Ans: Queue is a interface . Queue represent data structure designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue,
and elements removed from the beginning of the queue. It implement fifo methodology.

what is stack?
Ans: Stacks are abstract dataStructure but implement the lifo methodology.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans: FIFO - First in first out its used by queue .
LIFO -Last in last out implement by stack.

what is the order of complexity?
Ans: Order of complexity is a relative measure of how much cpu time a certain algorithm will take

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans: 0(1)

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Ans: 0(n)

what is tree in data structure?
Ans: A tree is any data structure in which are nodes that are connected by edges

what is graph in data structure?
Ans: A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HasMap?
Ans: HashMap is not threadsafe where as Hashtable is . HashTable does not allow null key/values but HashMaps do

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Ans: RDBMS – Array (i.e. Array of structures)
 Network data model – Graph
 Hierarchical data model – Trees

How HashMap works in java?
Ans: HashMaps work by storing key value pairs which can be use to compare results.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans: This is an Exception that occurs when we try to access a index in an array that does not exist

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans: Four different ways to copy all elements of one array into another array in Java. Manually, Arrays.copyOf(),
System.arraycopy(), Object.clone().

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans: arrays are fixed,linked lists are dynamic, arrays have constant access time, while linked lists do not.

What is DFS and BFS?
Ans: The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS) are the two algorithms used for traversing
and searching a node in a graph. They can also be used to find out whether a node is reachable from a given node
or not.

What is Recursion?
Ans: Recursion is the process in which a method repeatedly calls itself with smaller data set then the last until a
base case is reached

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Ans: linear data structures grow directly proportional to the number of elements, non linear DS grow either faster or
slower than linear ones.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans: It is a comparison that tells how an algorithm’s speed is related to the number of items.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Ans: Bubble Sort = n^2, InsertionSort = n^2, SelectionSort = 2^2 ,QuickSort = n log(n)) , Merge Sort = n log(n))

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.

Ans:Array: search o(n), access o(1), insert o(n), deletion o(n)
    ArrayList: search o(n), access o(1), insert o(n), deletion o(n)
    LinkedList: search o(n), access o(1), insert o(1), deletion o(1)
    Stack: search o(n), access o(n), insert o(1), deletion o(1)
    Queue: search o(n), access o(n), insert o(1), deletion o(1)
    B-Tree: search o(log n), access o(log n), insert o(log n), deletion o(log n)
