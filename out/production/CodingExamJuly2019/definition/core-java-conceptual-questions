Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
Ans: A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of
instructions for computers to execute.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Ans: Which compiles java soure code. we also java tool which executes the bytecode from the java compiler.
we also haJDK are a set of tools and libraries that are needed to run a java program.
jdk cove jar tool which contains classes and methods that accomplish a specific task.

What is IDE?
Ans: IDE stands for integrated development environment.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Ans: eclipse,intellij and netbeans.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans: We start with our source code in IDE. this gets converted to bytecode by the java compiler.
then the byte code is loaded into memory by the class loader and executed by the jvm into machine code

what is class?
Ans: A class is a blueprint of the states and behaviors .

What is object?
Ans: An object is a instance of a certain class with its own unique fields and behaviors

What is the entry point of an application?
Ans: Main Method

Why main is static?
Ans: if main was not static we would always have to create an instance of the main's class in order to use it

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Ans: The super class of all classes is the object class

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Ans: Path is used to store the location of jdk tools like javac or java, but classpath is used to store the location of
the flies and folders your application needs to run properly

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Ans: In an interface all methods must be declared only. In an abstract class you can have both abstract and non abstract
method.classes can implement many interfaces, but only one abstract class

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Ans: Interfaces and abstract classes cannot be instantiated, the only way to use them is for a class to implement a
interface or extend an abstract class

what is Access Specifier?
Ans: Access specifiers establish the permissions we have to access or modify members of a class within a certain scope.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Ans: Oop stands for object oriented programming. all java applications are based on the concept of objects.
there are oop concepts:
inheritence: this is when a class has access to the members of its parent without having to be reimplemented.
polymorhism: this is when a class can change the methods of its parents class to fit its specific needs as well as add
its own members.
encapsulation: this is when we restrict the scope of certain members so that they cannot be manipulated outside of the
class where they are defined, this is achieved with the "private keyword";
abstraction: abstraction is the process of implementation hiding.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Ans: A package is simply a folder or directory that stores related files and applications for easy access and readability
The default package is an unnamed package. The unnamed package contains java classes whose source files did not contain
a package declaration

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Ans: API stands for Application programming interface, it is essentially a service that we use to communicate one computer
with another.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Ans: java does not allow multiple inheritence, only One parent can be inherited from, but we can get around this by
implementing as many interfaces as we want.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans: Method overloading is when different methods with same name can exist as long as they have different parameters.
this occurs during compile time

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans: Exceptions are any event that disrupt the natural flow of an application, but can be handled without the need to
terminate the application.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans: The static keyword indicates that a member belongs to a class rather than a object. static variables are shared
by all objects and static methods can be accessed without needing a object reference.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Ans: The final keyword indicates that a member cannot be changed once declared. a final variable cannot be changed
and a final method cannot be overrided.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Ans: Final is a keyword.final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable.
Finally is a block of code that executes after a try catch block for code cleanup,
Finalize is a method called by java garbage collector that closes any open resources before destroying a object.

What is a constructor ?
Ans: A constructor is used to create an object

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Ans: Yes

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Ans: The default constructor is called

What is "this" keyword in java ?
Ans: This keyword is used to reference the current object whose method is being called

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. The super keyword is a reference to the parent class of an object

What is JVM stand for ?
Ans: JVM stands for java virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
Ans: Yes it is.

What version of java are you using?
Ans: Java 12

What is JAR stand for ?
Ans: jar stands for java archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
Ans: jdk stores all the tools and files need by java to run properly, Jvm is the executioner of java bte code.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
Ans:jvm is the virtual machine that executes bytecode it is inside JRE which contains other libraries and components
needed to run java applications.

What is compile time and run time?
Ans: Compile time is the stage when source code converted to byte code, runtime is when the byte code is being executed.

What is heap?
Ans: Heap is a section of ram in which all objects are stored

How java manage it's memory?
Ans: All references are stored in stack, all objects are stored in heap

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Ans:String is immutable,stringBuffer and stringBuilder are not. StringBuffer is thread safe, StringBuilder is not

What is Singleton class?
Ans: Singleton class is a class that allows only one instance object to be created

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Ans; Serialization is the process of converting objects to bytestream, Deserialization is the opposite process

when to use transient variable in java?
Ans: when we do not want a variable to serialized

Difference between while and do..while loop?
Ans: Do while will execute at least once, while loop will not execute if a condition is not met.

What is Enum?
Ans: Enum is a set of constants that are user defined

What is Iterator?
Ans: iterator is a method of the Iterable interface that is used to traverse over a collection.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Ans: an integer will take more memory because it is a object

Why is String Immutable in Java?
Ans: Strings are immutable because we cannot change their states once they are instantiated

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Ans: Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
Ans: Serial GC is used for single threaded environments, while Parallel GC is used in multithreaded environments

What is JIT stands for?
Ans: The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a component of the Java Runtime Environment that improves the performance of
Java applications at run time.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Ans: Heap space is the section of memory where objects are stored, Garbage collection clears the heap of any objects
that are not being used.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
Ans: An java garbage collection is automatic but it cannot be forced and it is not clear when the collection will occur

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Ans: Stacks hold object references  and local primitive variables, heaps store the actual objects

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Ans: Reflection is an API that is used to examine or modify the behaviour of methods, classes and interfaces at runtime.

what is multithreading in java?
Ans: Multithreading is a Java feature that allows two or more parts of a program to run at the same time  for maximum
utilization of CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Ans: Use synchronization to allow only one thread to access a cpu resource at a time.

What is Framework?
Ans: A framework is a large body of files or classes that we can add to our own code in order to solve a need

What are the testing Framework available in java?
Ans: The main two are testNg and Junit

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
Ans:  the main two are testNg and Junit

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
Ans: TestNg has all the features of junit plus added features such as dependency testing, group testing,object testing.

What are the dependencies for this project?
Ans: Dependency injection is when a object contains the dependencies of another object and is passed to it so that it
can use it.

what is dependency injection in java?
Ans: dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another
object.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Ans: Static binding refers to the calls that can be resolved at compilation time while, dynamic binding are the calls
that can be resolved only at runtime.
